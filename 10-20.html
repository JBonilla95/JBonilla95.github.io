                        <p>The Occupy Wall Street movement failed because it was demanding power but never realizing that they had it all along.</p>
                     
    
                            <p>Over the last century, and through some brilliant manipulation based on psychology, consumerism has become therapeutic and fills many people's emotional needs.</p>

                            <p>Feel bad? Go shopping for new clothes! You'll feel like a whole different person.</p>
                            <p>This attitude allowed corporations to get so massive that they now hold Congress in check.</p>
                            <p>The solution is so simple yet extremely difficult to do.</p>

                            <p>I will not buy new clothing, or shoes, or unnecessary snacks, for two entire years. I refuse to play this game.</p>
                            <p>I will make art out of my clothing, I will put it in my face, and thereby challenge the artists of the fashion industry.</p>

                        <p>With our bare eyes, humans are not aware of the complexities of the universe. We use tools to see particles, to see the other wavelengths of light, to see the beginning of time.</p>
                     
    
                            <p>If I want to study the power of observation and perception, what better place to start than by wearing and becoming art?</p>

                            <p>When art is carried within a person, people notice. Political statements are made. Gaga used it as a mask that one had to see past in order to realize how unique her essence was.</p>
                            <p>Kahlo used her body as a way to claim her authenticity and stay true to her essence.</p>
 <img class="img-responsive" src="img/spotlight.jpg" alt="">
 <span class="caption text-muted">Performance art is the closest we come to creating life.</span>
                            <p>It's funny how I realize that I've played this game all along. By wearing black, I expose only one thing: the person behind the clothing. Some choose to not see past that. By refusing to tie my shoelaces and not falling, I challenge such a simple belief that ticks people off.</p>
                            <p>But I can do more than that.</p>
                            <p>This is just an experiment</p>

                        <p>Heinsenberg's Uncertainty Theorem states that we cannot know both position and momentum of particles at the same time. Why should this be so?</p>
                     
    
                            <p>Back of the envelope calculations tell us that the speed of light and the energy transmitted during the act of observation hold the answer to this conundrum.</p>

                            <p>What occurs during this act of observation? Light enters the retina of a conscious being, and thus either position or momentum is fixed at that particular moment.</p>

                        <p>The current big quest in physics is to unify the laws of the quantum world with those of relativity and the macro world. String theory proposes that quarks, the building blocks of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of all atoms, otherwise known as hadrons, are not the smallest constituents. String theorists argue that quarks, and all fundamental matter, hold within them vibrating strings which hold multiple dimenstions.</p>
                     
    
                            <p>There is a twinge of humor in this whole affair that perhaps  means nothing, but perhaps can explain why string theory doesn't seem to fit just right.</p>

                            <p>Gell-Man's creative flair in naming quarks was a tad bit problematic. He obtained that term from a novel by James Joyce. Joyce, an author who played with our imagination and the power of interpretation.</p>
 <img class="img-responsive" src="img/Fractals.jpg" alt="">
                        <span class="caption text-muted">It must not be too deep. Remember Plato.</span>
                            <p>Consider his novel <strong>Ulysses.</strong> It's a world of its own. The characters just are. Living, breathing, mundane in the perfect sense. There is only one meaning to his novel, and it is what the reader makes it to be.</p>
                            <p>See the humor now? Naming fundamental particles after a term by Joyce. Of course quarks are so mysterious!</p>
                            <p>But just as Joyce comes to life when read, so does the quantum world. Maybe God does play with dice after all.</p>
                            <p>It's a game from now on: who can reach the hidden layer beneath the form of quarks, beneath the form of Joyce? There one must search.</p>

                        <p>First of all, I underappreciated the understanding of the Greeks. They too knew that irrationallity was the source of beauty, as evidenced by their frequent use of the golden ratio, an irrational number.</p>
    
                            <p>Duchamp said that art should be at the service of the mind, and Shoenberg experimented with atonality to create his haunting works.</p>

                            <p>Art should be more than beautiful: It must create understanding on its own. It must be like the Large Hadron Collider, and act as a vessel to understand the richness of the universe.</p>

                            <p>That means that it does not necessarily fit into our intuitions and expectations of beauty and rationality. A relative looking glass that gives birth to new ideas.</p>

Wind pushes the fringes of the scene
The air tastes like earth and mist
Water intermixed with trees, fixating on all surfaces. 
The boundaries of the storm curve along a cave,
A space holding the connections that perceive all.
 
Swirl, swirl, little breeze
Until you become a hurricane.
 
The entrails of the burrow are scraped and battered
There end is nowhere near.
 
There! There is the solution!
The tumbling air came to a still as the machine picked up the utensil.
Hold it, liberate the chaos through your appendages.
Pure energy ebbs through the rails, 
Until the final destination is covered in scratches.
 
Hurry, hurry now! The flow continues now until it all starts shaking.
The water pours, fills in the crevices deep in the ultimate surface. 
Nobody bears witness of the magic, nobody hears the flow of rushing waves.
The machine is on automatic, long ago programmed and now left as obsolete.
It runs its course, for otherwise destruction is eminent.
 
The storm calms its intensity.
The machine is spent, worn, yet serene as the now still waters.
It opens its eyes, and lets out a sigh.

                            <p>I must change the title, for now I know that chaos is what fueled the machine's production. It allowed creation.</p>

                            <p>There is a fear of chaos enrapturing me again, but I shall plunge into it.</p>

                            <p>That will prove my courage to myself and the universe.</p>

                        <p>Nature creates a beauty that is appreciated by humans through the use of irrationality.</p>
        
                            <p>Yet humans are so captivated by the form, by the symmetry, that they often fail to see the essence.</p>

                            <p>It is not intristic in human nature to look past the veil.</p>

                            <p>When I began drawing, I wanted beauty. I wanted my work to be realistic as possible, for I deemed that perfection.</p>

                            <p>But I was wrong. I have to explore irrationallity, dissonance, and chaos, for theirin lies beauty.</p>

                        <p>Now that my health is returning, I will do anything in my power to never again let it define me. My will shall control</p>
        
                            <p>The unification of physics, mathematics, philosophy and art. A task that perhaps only nature can undertake, but I will nevertheless attempt.</p>

                            <p>The first questions I will explore are: Is symmetry really the absolute perfection? The Greeks certainly thought so, and modern physicists strive to prove supersymmetry. But is it realistic?</p>

                            <p>Music is deemed more beautiful when the rations are well proportioned. Faces with near perfect symmetry are the ideal. 1:1, 1:2, 2:1, 2:2. On it goes.</p>

                            <p>But then there is pi. Not the most rational of the ratios, yet it is the one that nature uses the most. The most irrational ration is fundamental to the epitomy of symmetry: the circle.</p>

                            <p>Symmetry is not perfection.</p>

                        <p>I was a baby elephant at the circus my entire life. Looping around a circle on a rope. I set my focus high in an attempt to escape, but once the rope was cut, I kept on circling. Depression, panic disorder, and PTSD. Do real elephants get these illnesses too?</p>
            
                            <p>I had the sky before me but my mind refused to fly. I had to step outside the circle, but my ambiguity led me to hospitalization. Medication.</p>

                            <p>Now it is clear.</p>

                            <p>I want to test all limits, of myself and those of society. The challenger. The unifier of mathematics, physics, philosophy, and art.</p>

                            <p>The supplanter.</p>


                            <p>Watch me singe my hair with the heat of the sun.</p>
