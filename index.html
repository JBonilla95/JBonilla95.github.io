                        <p>Call me old fashioned, but I only believe that there are four dimensions.</p>
                     
    
                            <p>Sure, in mathematics you can work with more, but there is always going to be a gap in between mathematical equations and our own universe.</p>

                            <p>Consider the concept of infinity in the physical space between two objects. Say that distance is 2 meters. Mathematically, one can divide that space into infinite number of intervals just to get from point A to point B. </p>
                            <p>Yet the reality of it is that there are only a certain number of particles in between A and B, a quantity that does not equal infinity.</p>
                            <p>This simple example displays the disparity between the two fields, but I wonder, why is it possible to arrive at such conclusions mathematically?</p>

                        <p>It's Friday now, but I can't sleep. Silly fantasies pull at my heartstrings, but they refuse to materialize in front of me.</p>
                     
    
                            <p>Lorentz transformations are like translations in languages. They describe different states of motion. But just as all humans have the capacity for language, the transformations are possible because momentum is a 4 space.</p>

                            <p>Even gravity takes on more of a field role, shifting and changing under translation. Gravity can bend light because of the curvature of space time. </p>
                            <p>We all long to fight gravity, and take light for granted. But light transforms too. It carries information in the wave form, it transmits pressure in the particle form, it bends and sways and gives us life.</p>
                            <p>Without a medium, it retains its heat.</p>

                        <p>Asymmetry and dissonance are the basic requirements of growth. The veiled irrationality not only is where beauty lies, but perhaps even the key to life.</p>
                     
    
                            <p>The more complex organisms are the ones who survived the deadly game.</p>

                            <p>The great art movements are the ones who learn from irrationality and asymmetry. So I must keep experimenting.</p>
                            <p>This is going to take a while.</p>

                        <p>Like most artists, I would love to create but also to share my ideas with humanity.</p>
                     
    
                            <p>Unfortunately, beauty is what attracts visibility in the arts, and my work does not make beauty its focus. I often see beauty as inconsequential to the process.</p>

                            <p>The majority of my paintings firstly seek to experiment. I take lessons from books, life, music, art, math, dreams and my subconscious and apply them to the paper through the movements of my hands. </p>
                            <p>There are times when I do not know where I'm headed, but, as is often the case, initial conditions guide me to the final image, the final idea.</p>
                            <p>If I wanted to spread these ideas to a wider audience, I would have to take beauty into consideration, not just leave it as an afterthought. </p>

                        <p>The studies in topology, those of continuity, spaces, sets and geometries, like to keep their abstraction but they can apply to the description of shapes, the junction of structures in biological systems and organisms, and perhaps the release and interaction of energy.</p>
                     
    
                            <p>The operations permit the ability to create and transform figures and their encompassing space. You could describe it as the interaction of the qualitative and the quantitative (and their manipulations).</p>

                            <p>My usual question applies here as well: What if you extend this to other processes and fields? In art, lines and curves create positive and negative space. Escher left us captivating art with this in mind. </p>
                            <p>Another key area is that of continuity and discontinuity. Examples are found in photons and light waves, particles and their mass, bits of data and the screen in front of our eyes. It is interesting that most of these examples involve the concept of scale and human perception. </p>

What would happen if we cycled though chaos and continuous equations and process with the use of optimization or other algorithms? What is hidden in deliberate transformations?</p>

                        <p>Plato once said that art, in particular poetry, was useless because it only imitated after reality, but I wish to challenge that claim. I believe that art enhances reality.</p>
    
                            <p>When the artist chooses a particular scene or moment, they are involved in a process of storytelling. They deemed that choice as a representaion of the event but also because it conveyed a particular feeling.</p>

                            <p>Some of the events of daily life can only be properly processed and appreciated from an outside point of view. Time often provides this through the haze of memories, but the artist can capitalize on this.  </p>
                            <p>Emotions, the higlighting of specific features, beauty and ideas all blend together in a single piece in a manner that reality cannot commonly achieve in a single montage.</p>

                            <p>Art can go beyond the reality of the senses by employing imagination.</p>

                        <p>The winds of time erode at our memories and the outline of the environment. The sharpness is dulled as equilibrium is reached. </p>
    
                            <p>Euclidian geometry confronted the two dimensional space, and contemporary/traditional art still plays with the concepts of the line.</p>

                            <p>However, Non-Euclidean geometry explored the changes, the curves and the nuances of space. It is a shame that the graphical representation of 3 dimensional space is not as clear.</p>
                            <p>I will attempt to capture the essense of movement and transformations on a two dimensional surface. I could attempt making sculpture, but before that I want to explore the movements of the brush over the canvas.</p>

                          <p>I don't think it's just a matter of inside and outside. It's flux.</p>

                        <p>Diotima, tell me where the rational thought dissapeared. Tell me when the purge of hatred will end its march on our hearts. It is like PTSD, opening wounds to apply medication. But for how long?</p>
    
                            <p>I wonder if the Internet age and its interconnectedness will one day permit a peaceful homeostasis to arrive. Entropy, but the other way around.</p>

                            <p>The search for truths is often tainted with the spoils and distractions of competition. I am certain the path to absolute truth requires these stains to dissappear, and that can only happen once we recognize that love for the truth is the ideal.</p>
                            <p>I've mentioned my stance on consumerist culture, but I also believe that art and science need, now more than ever, step up to the public consciousness. I know my place now. </p>

                          <p>And what of relativity? Of movement? The absolute truths of light and of electrons dictate the relative truths. To know both is the goal, and the knowledge of this goal is the greatest glimmer of hope.</p>
